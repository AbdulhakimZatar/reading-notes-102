# How Computers Work?

## Introduction
While most of us use this revoultionary technology daily, we don't often ask how its work.

### How information is represented inside the computre?
Using tiny electrical signals going on and off.


## What Makes a Computer, a Computer?
1- Take input.
2- Store information.
3- Process information.
4- Output.

### Input
There is many input computers can handle like:
* Keyboard.
* Mouse.
* Microphone.
* Camera.
and many more.

### Storage and Process
Computer processor take information from storge it manipulates it or change it using an algorithm, then it sends the information back to storge.

### Output
A computer display can show text, photos, vidoes, game and more things.
Output of computer may  become input for another computer when using internet.


## Binary & Data

### How do you store or represent information using electricity?
If you have a single wire with electricity flowing through it, the signal could be on or off, with one wire we could represent yes or now or anything else with only two options, this yes/no state called a bit, and it's the smallest piece of infomation a computre can store.
If you use more wires you get more bits, with more bits you can handle complex information.

### Cn you represent numbers with only 0 and 1?
Yes, you can with only ones and zeros, example:
Number 9 in binarty is 1001; 1x8 + 0x4 + 0x2 + 1x1= 9.
Computers do it for us hopfuly :).

### What about other types of information?
Also all type of information could be represented with numbers.

### Sound in Binary
Vibration can be represented graphically as a waveform, any point on this waveform can be represented by a number.


## Hardware and Software

### Hardware
* circuits.
* chips.
* wires.
* speakers.
* plug.

### Software
Software is all of the computer programs, or code, running on this machine. 
Software can be anything from apps and games to webpages.

### How software and hardware work togther?
CPU receives simple commands that tell it which circuit to use to do a specific job.

### How does software look today?
* Python.
* Ruby.
* Blockly.

### Operating System
Operating system is the master program that manages how software gets to use the hardware of the computer.
