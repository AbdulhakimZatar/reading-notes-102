## What is Markdown?
Markdown is a way to style text on the web. You control the display of the document.
It is just regular text with a few non-alphabetic characters thrown in, like # or *.

### Why Markdown?
Many technical writers find lots of benefits in using Markdown for their documentation. Some of these benefits are:
Markdown provides semantic meaning for content in a relatively simple way
You can write rich formatted content extremely quickly (compared to writing directly in HTML tags)
You can read Markdown easily in plain text before rendered by HTML
It doesnâ€™t interrupt your workflow with the need to click buttons
